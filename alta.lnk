========================================================
Sundance ST201 ALTA (Another) NDIS 2.0.1 MAC driver 1.00
========================================================

1.Introduction

Sundance ST201 and IC+ IP100A are the Fast Ethernet chipsets.
D-Link DFE-550TX is known as the adapter which uses ST201.
It seems that D-Link had provided the official driver, though 
I've never seen it actually. We cannot acquire it now.
IC+ provides the datasheet, but does not provide the driver for OS/2 
on their website.

Included files are:
alta.os2	NDIS 2.0.1 MAC driver
alta.nif	Network Information File
alta.sym	Symbol Map file
alta.lnk	Document (this file)
source.zip	source files

You could download the latest file on the gomi:NDIS MAC Drivers page,

2.No Warranty

This code is provided 'AS IS' and any warranties are disclaimed.


3.Considerable configuration keywords

- BurstThresh, UrgentThresh, PollPeriod are not configurable 
  at this version driver.
- IP100A LF has not TxStartThresh nor RxEarlyThresh nor Countdown 
  registers. Perhaps store and forward.
- NETADDRESS and ENWOL are the hidden keywords. You should not use:-)


4.Note

Tested with DFE-550TX only.
I don't know whether this driver can work with IP100A... 
Error recovery is not sufficiently tested.
